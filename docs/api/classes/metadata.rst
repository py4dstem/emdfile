Metadata
========

``Metadata`` objects are the basic unit of metadata storage.
Each instance has a name and holds a collection of key:value pairs, with string-like keys and support for a variety of value data types.
Nesting is permitted by setting value to another Metadata instance.
Each node in an EMD tree may contain any number of Metadata instances.
