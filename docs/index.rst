``emdfile`` Documentation
=========================

The ``emdfile`` Python package reads and writes `HDF5 <https://emdatasets.com/the-hdf5-file-format>`_ files
following the `EMD 1.0 standard <https://emdatasets.com/format>`_, which is designed to hold arbitrary data and metadata.

``emdfile`` defines write and read functions and a set of data-containing classes which together interface between EMD 1.0 and Python runtime objects.  The classes enable quickly building, saving, and reading filetree-like representations of data and metadata.  It is built on HDF5 and ``h5py``.
